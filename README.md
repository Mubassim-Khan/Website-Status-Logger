## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

This repository contains the code for a Website Status Logger, which monitors the uptime and availability of various websites, including personal projects and social media platforms. The application periodically checks website statuses, logs the results, and automatically commits updates to GitHub using GitHub Actions. The backend is built with Flask, while the frontend displays website statuses in an interactive UI. This project helps in tracking website availability efficiently, ensuring quick detection of downtime or errors.

## <a name="features">Features</a>
👉 **Automated Website Monitoring**: The app periodically checks the status of websites, including personal projects and social media platforms, ensuring real-time uptime tracking.  

👉 **Categorized Website Status**: Websites are categorized into "Personal Projects" and "Social Media," displaying their status separately for better clarity.  

👉 **Detailed Logging System**: Logs every status check with timestamps in a structured log file, making it easy to track historical uptime and failures.  

👉 **Automatic GitHub Commits**: Uses GitHub Actions to automatically commit and push updated website statuses to the repository without manual intervention.  

👉 **Flask-Powered Web Interface**: Displays real-time website statuses on a dynamic web page built with Flask, offering a user-friendly dashboard.  

👉 **Bootstrap-Powered UI**: Uses Bootstrap's accordion layout for a sleek and responsive design, allowing users to expand and view website details conveniently.  

👉 **Customizable URL Lists**: Users can define their own list of websites to monitor by modifying a simple configuration file.  

👉 **Error Detection & Handling**: Captures HTTP errors and exceptions, marking websites as "DOWN" when unreachable or returning unexpected responses.
